## Requirements / Purpose

-   To create a dummy operating system with working applications
-   This project was to test my skills in page styling to try make as close of a clone to the Windows XP operating system as possible

---

## Build Steps

-   Open the ```index.html``` file in your browser

---

## Design Goals / Approach

-   To make the layout and colours look near identical to the Windows XP OS
-   Create three simple applications on the desktop to show modal usage

---

## Features

-   Working menu button
-   Desktop icons of three applications:
-- [Rock Paper Scissors]: Rock paper scissors game versus the computer.
-- [Calculator]: A simple calculator which takes in two numbers and returns an output based on a chosen operator.
-- [To Do List]: To do list with delete and highlight complete functionality.

---

## Known issues

-   Sometimes menu button breaks due to modal logic (unsure of cause)

---

## Future Goals

-   Develop more intricate applications
-   Recreate in React

---


## What did you struggle with?

-   It was my first time implementing a dialogue/modal so I had difficulties learning how it worked

---

## Licensing Details

-   Unlicensed
